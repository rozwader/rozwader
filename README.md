- What's Poppin?
- My name is rozwader.
- I won't say I'm starting, but I'm for sure not some senior developer with 1.502 light years of expierience.
- Currently I'm playing with web design, so JavaScript and stuff.
- Although I'm expierienced in Roblox Game making, mostly scripting (It's not much of a flex, but i spent 2 fricking years practicing it, so i'm gonna put it here anyway).

I'm not gonna do much here, just put some projects so it don't magically disapper from my computer.
Have a nice one!
